# My portfolio and resume

- Portfolio is in index.html
- Resume is in resume.html, resume.pdf and resume.docx

I edit resume in resume.html and then use **html-pdf** for html -> pdf conversion and https://pdf2docx.com/ for pdf -> docx conversion.

## TODO

- Make fonts sizes in portfolio smaller after breakpoint applies for better mobile experience
- Replace link to website in both resume and portfolio when I'll buy new domain
